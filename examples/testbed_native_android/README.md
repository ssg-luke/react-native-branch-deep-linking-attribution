# testbed_native_android

This app illustrates how to integrate the react-react-native-branch@2.0.0-beta.1-branch SDK into a React Native component within an existing native Android app.

The app was produced following the methodology outlined in these tutorials:

- https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/integration-with-existing-apps.html
- https://www.raywenderlich.com/136047/react-native-existing-app

## Building

To build and run, install NPM dependencies using `yarn` or `npm i`.

Also be sure to start the React packager manually unless you are packaging `index.android.bundle` in the app
assets.

```bash
yarn start
```

or

```bash
npm start
```
